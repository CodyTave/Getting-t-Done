NB: the .env file is pushed here for context since it is a public project also all the secret it has are local so it's ok ;)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## App Usage 

You should have mongoDb Installed and up and running and alter the .env MONGOURI to your Connection URI 
also make sure your running the server on the same port in the .env or change it accordingly
